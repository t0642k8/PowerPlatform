# How to build a Crisis Communication App.

The Microsoft Crisis Communications App is a great concept and it has potential used at our workPlace. As I was attempting to modify it to make it fit better for our orginization , every time I make a change it would create more problems.

I decided to start over and use the concepts that Microsoft used.
